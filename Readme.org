#+TITLE: Computational trinitarianism
#+AUTHOR: VojtechStep

This repository contains my research on computational trinitarianism and linear types, which is conducted for my undergraduate thesis at the Czech Technical University.

The documents are written as [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] files in Emacs, which are then exported to LaTeX and compiled to PDF using [[https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/][tectonic]].

The file [[file:ComputationalTrinitarianism.org][ComputationalTrinitarism.org]] contains my research on computational trinitarianism assuming the meet-implicative fragment of propositional intuitionistic logic, and [[file:Thesis.org][Thesis.org]] builds on the introduced concepts by replacing traditional intuitionistic logic with substructural linear logic.

The resulting documents are built automatically using GitHub Actions, so the newest version is always available at the [[https://github.com/VojtechStep/ComputationalTrinitarianism/releases][releases]] page.
